        <p>American beef stew doesn't have the same history or rules (thankfully) as some of the vaunted European stews like boeuf bourguignon or goulash. So long as the beef is tender and the stew is stew-like, nobody is going to tell you that you made it wrong. But there are a few archetypes. My own childhood experiences with beef stew started with a can of Dinty Moore (with its oddly firm potatoes and carrots) and ended with a homemade version with chunks of dry, stringy beef floundering in a gravy-like broth flavored with tomato paste.
         I'm not naming names, but the cook's name started with M and rhymed with "nom."</p>
         
         <p>There are two things these versions of American beef stew, and indeed most versions have in common: 
            they are simple, and they prioritize convenience over flavor.</p>
