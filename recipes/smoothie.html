        <p>A smoothie is a thick and creamy beverage and made from a variety of ingredients placed in a blender. The ingredients are pureed until you have a smooth concoction. One of the most excellent features of smoothies is that they can contain whatever is desired. 
            One of the benefits of drinking smoothies for breakfast is that they can provide a source of energy and protein. Research studies have found that higher protein intake makes people feel fuller and reduces food cravings later in the day. Proteins are complex molecules that take longer to break down than carbohydrates, so they provide longer-lasting energy.
            The nutritional value and calorie count of smoothies depend on the choices you make for ingredients. For example, using whole milk instead of low-fat milk adds sugar and calories to the smoothie.
